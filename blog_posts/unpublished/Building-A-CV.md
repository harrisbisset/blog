# Building a CV

I wake up, it's Christmas and I'm in a bad mood. I fucking hate LinkedIn.

Well not really, but most of the people inspire something deep within me. I might want to preface the rest of this with: I'm pretty competitive, like an irrational-dislike-of-people-I-don't-know type of competitive.

## So, what's this go to do with LinkedIn?

Well, I get to see people at my university crafting their profiles, or rather their CVs.

Have I been slacking, maybe, but it's not like I don't do other things. I do sport for ~15 hours a week as a base thing. Plus I've been ill for at least 8 months of the year, then had surgery. So it's not like I haven't had things going on, but even if you did get a sticker saying "good work, you tried hard".

Do I do enough? I mean personally the answer will always be no, but am I setting myself up for the success I want. The answer, still no. At least right now.

I mean, I can only be happy with myself if I did the right things.

I mean I hate my prior posts, and think they're cringe. I'm aware no one's really reading them, so I leave them up to at least have a catalogue.

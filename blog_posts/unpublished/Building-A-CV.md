# Building a CV

> The _brightest minds_ in the undergrad think-tank are at it again

I feel like this a really a deeply personal journey that...

But really, what can you do?

- Build projects
- Network
- Get internships
- Build a personal website
- Extracurriculars

Wow, very inspirational mister! I sure hope you patented those ideas.

## But like what actually could you do

Sarcasm aside, let's build some imaginary profiles because...

Well, you probably aren't reading this article if you want to hear the usual generic advice.

### Fintech

The easy way to do something in fintech is probably:

- Math modules
- Network at financial societies
- Read boring math books
- Go all in on ML and AI

You'll probably find something doing this, unless a quarter of the people on my course are also wrong.

But we're not here to do all that, well actually we might be here to do more. So let's start from the end of the fintech story: what are you really going to work with.

It's probably going to be some combination of ML (maybe Python), low latency systems (likely written in C++, Java or Go), data analytics and networking.

In a company, this could look like getting the right data to the right people, analysing performance (markets, trades, etc.) and creating the next ML-drived strading strategy. However, not all of these are possible.

#### Idea

Let's look at what we can forgo:

- low latency: doesn't matter since making a correct financial decision is probably harder (everyone has their own Tequila Shot Monday)
- ML: unless you're doing something relatively basic, it's hard enough as it is with teams of people working on it
- networking: not going to be a problem when there isn't going to be much network activity
- performance analysis: we do not have all that data, or enough knowledge to manipulate it

But, we can:

- capture the right data
- basic analysis of this data

#### Solution

A board, where data is available (stocks, attached pdfs, etc.), people can make theses (which can be commented on), minutes can be held. In short, the perfect online platform for a financial student club to manage itself.

If you were to make it catchy, think Discord + Obsidian but for management.

### Data analytics

Well, it's hard to get high quality analytics data for free, and analysing it is even harder. What isn't difficult

## Conclusion

Who knows what happens though, I sure know I can't be trusted to predict what I'll do in 1-2 months time.

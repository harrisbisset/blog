# The First Step

> or how learning software could change for the better

Usually 9/10 things you develop in a project are neither groundbreaking nor new. Usually you're selling a feature that's built from the top-down, not a system built from the bottom-up. However, knowing which technologies fit your use-case, when to use them and how to use them is always difficult.

The process of discovering technologies or ideas usually consists of browsing through blog posts, forum threads, or maybe talking to an LLM. You might notice a problem: none of these resources were made, or are maintained as, an education platform.

## Persistence of Data

There are many of core ideas of teaching: standarisation, equal access to teaching and easy access of materials. None of this can exist on the web if resource links die and old content is deleted. The first guarentee of any educational resource is stability. From the moment it is launched, nothing should be lost. *You don't burn books in a library*.

From a stable foundation standards can grow, utility resources can be made and maybe you too can learn C black magic.

## Simple as a Principle



RFCs are a great example of presistent education, but they mean somthing.

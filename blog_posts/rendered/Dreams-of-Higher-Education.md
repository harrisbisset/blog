<h1>Dreams of Higher Education</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>or how learning could change for the better</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Higher education historically catered to a small market, but over time this has shifted. This is because high-skill employers now look for degrees, where experience is absent. While the market has changed a lot, the skills learnt and process undertaken has changed significantly less. This has created great inefficencies in education and employement.</p>
<p>Across academic institutions degrees are broadly incomparable, exams are often a nightmare for students and staff, and teaching resources are garbage<a href="#1">¹</a>. I think this is a national failure. When outcomes for people are so vastly different<a href="#2">²</a>, why are we not investing in a better education?</p>
<h2>What better looks like</h2>
<p>I think the first building block of a better higher education is standardised qualifications - open and accessible. In the tech world, huge leaps and bounds have been made from open sourcing technologies, why should a hundred people build the same thing, when it can be built once and better. The same should go for higher education.</p>
<p>This could be valuable not only for students, but for educators.</p>
<h3>Persistence of Data</h3>
<p>Depending on data is difficult on the web, resource links die and old content is deleted. The first guarentee of any educational resource is stability. From the moment it is launched, nothing should be lost. <em>You don't burn books in a library</em>.</p>
<h3>Modular</h3>
<p>The system should not restrict users. Any user should be able to create additional resources, as a larger part of this system.</p>
<p>Maybe 'Computing 101' is the only standardised module across higher education, and then courses are self-developed. This loses a lot of benefits from the solution, but forcing users to standardise everything may lead to poor adpotion, especially as standardisation may take time.</p>
<h3>Free</h3>
<p>Resources should be free by default. Selling standards leads to poor adoption, and complex systems to protect data depending on the terms of sale. Revenue can be generated from consulting, hosting and additional services; planting a forest to sell axes.</p>
<h3>Accessible</h3>
<p>Free does not mean easy to use or contribute to. Without accessibility, secondary education standarisation will have just been recreated.</p>
<p>Students can also easily build resources for themselves if this is the case.</p>
<h2>How does better start</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not a pitch for funding. If anything is to be built, it better start small.</p>
<h3>Core Ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li>Resource hosting</li>
<li>Version control</li>
<li>Forum experience (like github issues/pull reqs etc.)</li>
<li>Formats for documents</li>
<li>System for people to upload courses/resources to</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<h3>1</h3>
<p>My experience with teaching resources is only being given a powerpoint on the subject.</p>
<h3>2</h3>
<p>The difference in salary between graduates and non-graduates is thousands of £GBP.</p>

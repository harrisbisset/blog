<h1>Goodbye 2024</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>New year, new problems</p>

<p>Now, what did I do this year. A more appropriate question might be what didn't I do? Enough.</p>
<p>Doom, gloom and mediocre blog posts out of the way - it was quite productive. Go, AWS, Docker and Postgrest are probably the three skills I can add to my LinkedIn. Just in time really, it's looking a bit bare.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.vdeck.uk/">VDeck</a></h3>
<p>Site deployed to AWS on EC2 using Docker, written in Go and using Postgrest for database. The technical details are: routing with Fiber, templating with Templ and Supabase for Postgrest.</p>
<p>Basically the project which has led my learning this year. I'm really starting to see how the biggest hurdle is simply knowing what solutions exist for a problem.</p>
<h3>This Blog</h3>
<p>Site deployed on Railway using Docker and written in Go.</p>
<p>I've recently decoupled a lot of the logic from the server, so I could redo the markdown processing at a later date and write a backend localhost server for writing.</p>
<h3>OCaml</h3>
<p>Small forey into OCaml, but I doubt I'll be going too far into it. Very nice pattern matching though.</p>
<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
<p>That's most of what's finished. I'm still working on other stuff, like a dashboard for a company's database.</p>
<p>As well as maybe-projects like an auto doc tool, or something in Zig, the rest of this blog, and updates to the existing site I'm managing.</p>

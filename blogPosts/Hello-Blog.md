# Hello Blog!
> *Disclaimer: This is mostly just an introductory text for my blog, for testing purposes*

Hi, if you've found this it's probably by mistake, but let me introduce myself.
I'm Harris, currently a 1st year uni student who's viciously addicted to programming
and rowing (if you could only pick two vices).

This blog serves as me making an effort to further beyond python and attempting to
build an actual product (albeit one that makes no money üôÅ). I'll likely aim to extend 
this blog to be able to include media snippets, code linting, or a variety of other
side things (I'm convinced a webring for programming blogs would be cool). This all
depends on what's fun though. Although fun is *relative* all things considering.

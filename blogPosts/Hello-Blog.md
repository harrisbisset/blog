# Hello Blog!
> *Disclaimer: This is mostly just an introductory text for my blog*

Hi. If you've found this, it's probably by mistake, but let me introduce myself. I'm Harris, a 1st year CS student who's viciously addicted to programming and rowing (if you could only pick two vices).

This blog serves as me making a real effort to go beyond Python: an attempt to build an actual product (albeit one that makes no money 🙁). It also marks a promise to myself, a promise that I will expand the blog's functionality and keep posting. However, inclusions will likely be items focused on the things that keep me up at night, which right now would be jobs.

*insert graph about layoffs*

Yes, I'm 3 and 1/2 years from finding a real job, but after hearing talk about this for a year. Curiosity got the better of me and [indeed](https://uk.indeed.com/jobs?q=software+developer&l=United+Kingdom) killed this cat; At first glance, tech jobs look dire. 

It's just languages I'm not keen on (PHP, C#, and Java), technologies I've ignored (TS and React), and things I'd rather avoid (C and C++). Not to mention limited junior roles in my area. 
I'm not saying no to learning, but I'm not particularly excited about these things. Mostly because I have a rough idea of projects I want to make in the near future, and almost none of these technologies suit the specifications.
- It's simply faster and easier to write a website on Go with templ and htmx, than PHP, or React, and TS. 
- It's as performant and easier to write a web-scrapering script in Python than Java, C#, or TS (for myself at least). 
- I'd rather use Go than C or C++ to build highly performant code.

## But here's how I'm going to change my mind
> *warning: there's an asterisk here*
- I'm going to make use of Python's C interop to write C.
- I'll host at least one more site built with TS and React, likely as an experiment to create heatmaps (and more) of user interactions. And, if I use node.js, I can also use write C++ addons for this idea -> maybe to process/handle data (I'm sure I'll find a usecase).
- Java is the main language I learn at university, so that kinda solves itself
- If you made it this far, I hope you've forgotten I mentioned C# or PHP
On a serious note, I plan on writing some C# and PHP. Like small projects in PHP + blazingly hot technologies, like Rust.


Of course, I still want to find reasons to pipe juicy goodness into my stack. Haskell, Ocaml, Elixir, another language that's incredibly narrow... 😩 it's a hard life.

# My Blog

A blog written in go, using fiber, templ, htmx and tailwind.


## TODO:
* Populate about page
* More post-styling applied on .md
  * Code Block
  * HR lines
  * Links
  * Mini Heading
* Make dark mode better
* Write .md to html, and save them, so page generation happens once, and can be done before server goes live.

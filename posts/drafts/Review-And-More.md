# Go-ing Up
> Quarter 2, Version 2

It's a bit too late to write a *New Year, New Me*, but personally I find it's more like, *New **Quarter**, New Me*. But that's not cool is it?

Anyway, did I make it past January? No. I didn't even make it to the new year 😞. So why did that happen?

Well, in my case, I didn't have anything I wanted to build that required those technologies. And unlike what I said, I didn't build random stuff with them.

So, what did I do instead? As, contrary to what my parents believe, I don't just hibernate all day.

## The Bear Cave of Productivity
* Building a website for my parents (Golang)
  - In-progress
* Writing scripts I could use for a task manager (Python)
  - In-progress (scripts finshed, but I need to write the terminal code)
  - Multiple minor rowing project websites (Golang)
  - Barely started to almost useable
* Making my own vscode theme
  - Unpublished and in-progress
* Minor fixes for this blog (Golang)
  - Hah, finished (although there are features I plan to add)
* COURSEWORK 🙁
  - Still in-progress sadly
  - Who knew uni required effort, clearly not first semester me!

Enter, the Productive Stack! At least it's not just a white-paper or a build system to fit my Workflow™.

Also, where would I be without simultaneously having nothing to work on. Clearly illustrated by my list of completed tasks.

See mum, I'm not a docile, sleepy bear; I'm a fearless, man-eating bear!

## The Never-ending Pile (of bones)

* A site to collate tech conference talks.
 
  - Inspired by something [Mr T3](https://t3.gg/) brought up.

  - The goal is to centralise tech talks, to where they can be consumed by everyone. This can be thought of as a twitter/reddit - fication of these random small youtube channels I get suggested every two weeks.

  - This is filling a hole, which could probably be added as a feature for youtube. Some sort of regulated community of channels (if you are reading this, and you work on the youtube side of things at Google: This is might be a good idea)

  - The primary service will just be listing the video, as packaged features like an api and RSS feed. The next features could invcluse an automated editing pipe-line (probably needs a little human verification). Time to note inspo from . Also, 
  Once there is enough content, the api would need to be expanded, as well as a adding a feature medium search page. Anyway, this isn't so much a roadmap, as rough estimate, if I get round to building this.

  - Regardless, I would like to do this as a personal project.

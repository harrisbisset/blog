# Go-ing Up

> Quarter 2, Version 2

It's a bit too late to write a _New Year, New Me_, but I always find _New **Quarter**, New Me_ is more relatable anyway. Not something I'd say outloud, but something I regularly internalise.

So, did I make it past January? Nope. Infact, I didn't even make it to the new year 😞.

#### What did I do Wrong?

Well, in my case, I didn't have anything I wanted to build that required those technologies. And despite self-affirmations, I didn't suddenly become another person who likes writing random programs to learn. Turns out you can't convince yourself to enjoy something. Crazy, I know.

#### So, what did I do instead?

Well, contrary to what my parents believe, I don't just hibernate all day.

## The Bear Cave of Productivity

> 🚀 _Quarterly earnings up by 100%_

- Building a semi-projessional website (Golang)
  - In-progress
- Writing scripts I could use for a task manager (Python)
  - In-progress (scripts finshed, but I need to write the terminal code)
- Multiple minor rowing websites (Golang)
  - Barely started to almost useable
- Making my own vscode theme
  - Unpublished and in-progress
- Minor fixes for this blog (Golang)
  - Hah, finished (although there are features I plan to add)
- Univeristy Coursework 🙁
  - Still in-progress sadly
  - Who knew uni required effort, clearly not first semester me!

Enter, the Productive Stack! At least it's not just a white-paper or a build system to fit my Workflow™.

Also, where would I be without simultaneously having nothing to work on, and a list of things I need to do higher than my unwashed dishes (**_hilarious 1st year student joke_**).

## The Never-ending Pile (of bones)

### A site to collate high quality tech content

> Inspired by something [Mr T3](https://t3.gg/) brought up. However, I can't find the link.

The goal is to centralise tech talks and blog posts into a feed that can be consumed by anyone. This can be thought of as a reddit-ification of these random small youtube channels I get suggested every two weeks. Or blogs I lose track of every now and again.

The primary service would be a video feed, a navigatable list of blogs, and an api. There should also be a basic search system. Also, the goal isn't really to retain traffic or take content, we're not storing the content.

This could stay static and be pretty decent, but some definite bonus features could include:

- A feed for blog posts (which could be done by automatically scraping the site, or using RSS).
- A more advanced search system, automatically applied tags for video depending on context.
- A CMS for owner's of the relevant blogs/videos, to update tags/add content manually.
- Comments

There could also be lower quality content from youtubers (in another feed), but there's abviously a limit here. Like personally I think TechLead's content doesn't meet the bar, but other people may disagree, and content massively varies. It would have to be a curated list, maybe one where people could submit singular videos, or their channel.

**_Side Note_**: The video side of things could even be a feature for youtube. Some sort of regulated community of channels (if you are reading this, and you work on the youtube side of things at Google: This is might be a good idea).

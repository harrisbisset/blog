<h1>Go-ing Up</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Quarter 2, Version 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a bit too late to write a <em>New Year, New Me</em>, but I always find <em>New <strong>Quarter</strong>, New Me</em> is more relatable anyway. Not something I'd say outloud, but something I regularly internalise.</p>
<p>So, did I make it past January? Nope. Infact, I didn't even make it to the new year üòû.</p>
<h4>What did I do Wrong?</h4>
<p>Well, in my case, I didn't have anything I wanted to build that required those technologies. And despite self-affirmations, I didn't suddenly become another person who likes writing random programs to learn. Turns out you can't convince yourself to enjoy something. Crazy, I know.</p>
<h4>So, what did I do instead?</h4>
<p>Well, contrary to what my parents believe, I don't just hibernate all day.</p>

<p>Enter, the Productive Stack! At least it's not just a white-paper or a build system to fit my Workflow‚Ñ¢.</p>
<p>Also, where would I be without simultaneously having nothing to work on, and a list of things I need to do higher than my unwashed dishes (<strong><em>hilarious 1st year student joke</em></strong>).</p>

<h2>The Never-ending Pile (of bones)</h2>
<h3>A site to collate high quality tech content</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Inspired by something <a href="https://t3.gg/">Mr T3</a> brought up. However, I can't find the link.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal is to centralise tech talks and blog posts into a feed that can be consumed by anyone. This can be thought of as a reddit-ification of these random small youtube channels I get suggested every two weeks. Or blogs I lose track of every now and again.</p>
<p>The primary service would be a video feed, a navigatable list of blogs, and an api. There should also be a basic search system. Also, the goal isn't really to retain traffic or take content, we're not storing the content.</p>
<p>This could stay static and be pretty decent, but some definite bonus features could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A feed for blog posts (which could be done by automatically scraping the site, or using RSS).</li>
<li>A more advanced search system, automatically applied tags for video depending on context.</li>
<li>A CMS for owner's of the relevant blogs/videos, to update tags/add content manually.</li>
<li>Comments</li>
</ul>
<p>There could also be lower quality content from youtubers (in another feed), but there's abviously a limit here. Like personally I think TechLead's content doesn't meet the bar, but other people may disagree, and content massively varies. It would have to be a curated list, maybe one where people could submit singular videos, or their channel.</p>
<p><strong><em>Side Note</em></strong>: The video side of things could even be a feature for youtube. Some sort of regulated community of channels (if you are reading this, and you work on the youtube side of things at Google: This is might be a good idea).</p>
